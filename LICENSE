    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work
(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
   Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:

i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and
translate a Work; ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
performer(s); iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image
or likeness depicted in a Work; iv. rights protecting against unfair competition
in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; v.
rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a
Work; vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection
of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any
amended or successor version of such directive); and vii. other similar,
equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law
or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to
   the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such
   Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
   Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable
   and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
   in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
   provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions),
   (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
   for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
   advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be
   deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work.
   Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
   ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness
   shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer
   hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her
   remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
   associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either
   case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. b. Affirmer offers
the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning
the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation
warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
extent permissible under applicable law. c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility
for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use
thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights
in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
Work. d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or
use of the Work.

   features, services, or peripheral devices.
8. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide
   for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire
   agreement for the software.
9. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in
   the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live
   (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern
   the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other
   claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims),
   regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software in
   any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you
   and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal
   court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you
   and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior
   Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.
10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal
    rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws
    of your state, province, or country. Separate and apart from your
    relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the
    party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change
    those other rights if the laws of your state, province, or country do not
    permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the
    below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following
    provisions apply to you: a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under
    the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to
    affect those rights. b) Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you
    may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature,
    disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to
    the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing
    updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any,
    may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or
    software. c) Germany and Austria. i. Warranty. The properly licensed
    software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials
    that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual
    guarantee in relation to the licensed software. ii. Limitation of Liability.
    In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the
    Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical
    injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law. Subject to the
    foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if
    Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the
    fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the
    breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the
    compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal
    obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be
    liable for slight negligence.
11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK
    OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR
    CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT
    EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING
    DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
    MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT
    RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL,
    INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. This limitation applies to (a) anything
    related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party
    Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of
    contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence,
    or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by
    applicable law. It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known
    about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may
    not apply to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the
    exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.

this agreement are provided below in French. Remarque: Ce logiciel étant
distribué au Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies
ci-dessous en français. EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une
licence est offert « tel quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre

LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES
DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une
indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous

garantie, ou au titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre
faute dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur. Elle s’applique également,
même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un tel
dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de
responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que
ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera
pas à votre égard. EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits
juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre
pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois
de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
